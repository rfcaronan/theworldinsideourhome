So which wood is popular? The pie chart shows that Sawn wood has been the most imported type of wood to the UK every year from 2008 until 2017. Sawn wood is wood that has been cut lengthways into planks that are ready to be used in construction and furniture making, which was already cut and processed before importing it to the UK.</p>

Why would the UK import raw wood from other countries if they can grow and cut their Roundwood locally? Steve Coombes, a Lecturer at Cardiff University in an interview said: 
                    <blockquote>“There are complications in terms of processing it and transporting it around the country or the world, sometimes it is ecologically friendlier to ship wood from Norway or Sweden to the North of the UK than driving wood across the country.”</blockquote>

However, looking at the time scale, the value of wood has been dropping, which could mean more affordable wood products for the British population. The fall in the value of wood can also signify the decrease in demand for wood in wooden products or in construction, which in turn would make you think that less wood is being cut down which is better for the environment. But is that the case?</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Following on from an Interview with Steve Coombes, after being asked a question whether generally, the UK moved on to other materials in furniture production and construction he replied: 
                <blockquote>“The industrial revolution in the UK changed the way that we use timber. Before that, we were timber-based like other European countries. We went down that route for lots of reasons such as the fire of London, which changed the materials we use and we moved more towards bricks, steel and then concrete and glass and timber slightly lost its way.”</blockquote> </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">Nevertheless, even if the UK has moved more towards other materials in construction it remains a major part in the lives of the British. Furthermore, Steve Coombes believes timber is the <q>ultimate future material</q> for the changing environment and climate change. He adds: 
                <blockquote>“It locks in carbon, its renewable it can grow anywhere. You can grow distinct species for different purposes, you can get different yield classes which is the time it takes to grow to be practically useable. Whereas oak takes a lot longer than a sicker spree tree, for example.”  </blockquote></p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">The takeaway - the most important aspect of wood usage is to make sure the wood comes from a sustainable source. If demand for wood increases, it is important to plant a tree (or more) for every tree that is being cut down. If the processing of wood is kept to a local level, it has the chance to aid the environment with reforestation which in turn will lock in more carbon.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">According to the Comtrade database, in 2019 imports consisted of bedroom wooden furniture and wooden seats (upholstered with textile and non-upholstered). 13.3 million items were imported to the UK in 2019 alone for bedroom use, the combined import of wooden framed seats was 17 million. This amount would equal to 45% of the UK population, so 30 million people could buy one wooden seat or bedroom furniture item in 2019. Exports for the UK show that wooden furniture for kitchen use was exported most in 2019 in comparison to bedroom furniture and wooden seats, which can signal that people tend to change their bedroom furniture and seats more often than kitchen units which of course is a more complex process. The same trend can be seen throughout the years from 2008 until 2019.</p>

             <div class="sub-section">
                <p class="story-paragraphs one-column-text">The numbers in 2008 are quite like in 2019, there is not much fluctuation in the number of wooden furniture imports. All years see imports higher than 23 million items. The total number imported is 240 million, that means every person in the UK can buy 3.5 new wooden furniture items in 11 years.</p>

Of course, it is plastic items! Wooden cutlery and tableware are higher in imports than metal cutlery and tableware.

However, we can see the imports for wood are higher, which can indicate a higher demand for such products.</p>
